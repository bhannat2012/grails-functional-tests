  <title>DB Utils - Embedded</title>
  <description>Embedded dbs, like derby &amp; in-memory HSQL only allow access from within the JVM that is accessing the db. This presents a problem that you cannot run an external db admin tool to work with the db while your grails app is running. To get around this limitation I wrote small plugin (1 controller &amp; 3 gsps) that can be used to admin the db within the running grails' app. 
There are three actions with the following urls described below...

/$appname$/dbUtil/info - Shows info about the db (tables/columns/column type, etc)
/$appname$/dbUtil/data - Outputs all the actual data alphabetically by table
/$appname$/dbUtil/sql - Allows free-form select/update/delete commands

Note: I've included commons-dbutils-1.1 from apache in the lib directory.

IMPORTANT: You will definitely want to protect this controller's url from unauthorized access since the sql action can be used to do just about anything.
